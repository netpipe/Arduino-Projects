# Python? Seriously? 
This is the staging ground for a new gru based architecture for uspeech. it uses the uspeech metric and the normalized loudmess as feature vectors. Fortunately google's speech dataset has been a boon as it simplifies the training process. I am currently in the process of implementing Song Han's deep compressiom for grus.
